thousands to minecraft players","keywords":[""],"articleBody":"Tournaments Intro All this Minecraft tournaments are Speedrunning tournaments, we call it MCSR (Minecraft Speedrunning) to make it short.\nI have always been a Minecraft Fan, and around the end of 2019, I started to play speedruns, and not long after the COVID-19 lockdown started, I started talking more to the community, learned how to speak english better, got to know a lot of people that i still talk to this day.\nAround setember 2020, a oppurtunity came up to help a tournament that was being organized, because Marco, one of the only brazilian players that knew me was one of the people organizing it, but thats not relevant, I got a chance to help make something really cool and I took it.\nMCSR 1.7 Tournament While im not going to explain how the speedrun works, the Tournament is very simple, it is in Minecraft 1.7 version, 2 players create worlds using the same World seed, the first one to beat the Ender Dragon wins that round, first to win 2 rounds wins the match.\nThe part where i was called to help is finding and filtering seeds, me and the 3 other people that were doing this had a list of around 10 thousand seeds that could be good, we got them using a program that reversed engineered the world creating process, but after that we had to check manually if the seed was actually good or not.\nIt was a boring process, we checked the quality of each seed based if it had the necessary items, food, terrain generation, structure generation, and more. In the end we manually checked around 2000 seeds, with around 90 of them being actually good.\nIn this Tournament I also had the chance to be a commentator of a match, which I was very nervous about, since It was in english and i was 15 years old, but it was a lot of fun, and there is this funny clip of my dog barking in the livestream with 100+ people\nTwitch clip\nCopa Brasileira 1.16 This tournament was bound to have issues, we had a smaller staff, since the brazilian community is smaller, everyone was doing a little bit of everything, and the staff was made up of people aged 21 to 12 years old, so you can guess how that went.\nThis time I had more things to do, I had to check the Seeds, make the overlays for the twitch livestream and be the stream tech, organize with the players to know when they can play, make the bracket, comentate matches and more, everyone was doing a little bit of everything, which means no one was doing things right.\nTwitch Clip\nThis was the first tournament where I had to actually deal with technical issues and problems with the players, all of them stuck in my mind so I dont repeat them in the future, some examples:\nSub par seeds, we didnt have a proper standard between the staff on what is a good seed Bad Stream overlay, we made it in 15 minutes, it didnt have the chat in the screen and other useful info Bad communication with the players, about match times, rules, format etc. Technical problems, maps and other resources we made to make the matches better not working A problem that people still remember is when SpectroPlayer, a popular Youtuber, lost a match, didnt understand the format of the tournament, then didnt respond any of our messages asking him to schedule his next match, which lead to the whole tournament stalling for a while, and a lot people having resentments towards him, something that eventually made him and another youtuber leave the community.\nThis tournament had no prizepool, we didnt even consider giving money away.\n1.16 Duos Tournament This Tournament was cancelled, but I think its worth a mention.\nIn my opinion the key issues were:\nThere wasnt a lot of interest in Coop speedrunning, it is a fun gimmick, but not a lot of people want to actually do it Schedule problems, instead of 2 players + Staff per match its 4 players + Staff, and a lot of the staff was going to play too, so it was a scheduling nightmare, and we didnt have the proper system for that. Technical problems, sometimes you cant connect to your friends world, and no one can pinpoint the issue, because its usually not the players fault, sometimes its the Firewall, sometimes its your ISP. Lag, a lot of players didnt play or hosted coop runs up until that point, and the lag some people had could make it frustrating to play. Other Tournaments There were some tournaments and events I didn’t do a lot, some of them i will write more in the “tools” section, but others i just didnt have much to do with\nBTRL 1 \u0026 2 BTRL or Break the record live is a marathon event, players have X amount of time to get the best time possible in a specific category, with the main objective being to break the record. These 2 events didnt need a lot of preparation, setup, since its just the players playing solo while streaming to twitch, where we then use those streams to feed into our main stream.\nBTRL 2 had R$165 of prizepool, donated by a member from the community.\nXandeHR 1 \u0026 2 XandeHR was also a marathon event, players had a limited amount of hours to get the biggest amount of times below a certain time.\nThe diferencial of this event was that the seeds players were getting werent random, they where filtered seeds that had better structures for speedrunning, making it more fun to play.\nThe name is a play on the name of the organizer, Alexandre.\nMy contribution to this event was in XandeHR 2, where the system to get the filtered seeds in the game stopped working in the dawn of the event, so at 3AM I was making a new simpler solution so they didnt need to cancel the event.\nCopa Brasileira 1.16 2 This was the second edition of the tournament that first took place 2 years ago, this time we wanted to do something bigger, with a prizepool, get more viewers and just make a better looking tournament.\nWe had:\nMatches streamed in a bigger channel, SpeedrunsBrasil, with 50k followers Good looking stream overlay R$750 on the Prizepool, donated by various community members Better game tools But we also had problems, some with the channel that was streaming our matches, not having control over our “output” and times that the matches could happen was something that stressed people a bit, because of this we only have 1 of all the matches that were streamed, all the others ones are lost, since they werent on our channel.\nOther than the host problems, and some other minor staff fighting, the tournament was a success, but in everything that we made from this point onward we needed to have 100% control over what was ours.\nCopa Brasileira 1.14 This was a bad one.\nIts hard to explain this one, the version 1.14 isn’t that fun to play for the average player, few people play it in the world, its boring to watch, but 2 admins really liked this version, so this tournament was made, with a R$425 prizepool.\nSome of the problems:\nPeople didnt want to play the tournament, organizers had to beg and guilt trip players to participate. Some were happy that they were eliminated, not really good for a competitive tournament. Staff didnt want to host or comentate the tournament. The community didnt want to watch it, it was boring. People dropped out of the tournament, people signed up but changed their minds last second. A lot of matches were played, but it got to the point where no one wanted to host play or do anything, and the community didnt want to watch it, i contacted everyone who donated to the prizepool, explained the situation, they agreed to use the money for other tournaments, and it was cancelled.\nThe tournament was a failure, but it was a learning experience to only do things that the broader community thinks is cool, otherwise we get no support.\nBTRL 3 This was in december of 2023, a break the record live event, at first with only R$123 in prizepool, but then we got a donation for R$1000 for the person who beats the Brazilian record, valid until the end of 2023, the biggest prizepool up to that point.\nBoosterruns was the one to claim the prize in the second day of the event, no one else came close so he “went home” with an extra 1k in his pocket, this event was pretty much the “start” of a new era, with tournaments with bigger prizes, better quality of the production and the overall skill of the players getting better.\nThe biggest challenge of this one was the livestream, i coded something to make changing who was the main player on the livestream easier, but we still had the problem of rendering 5 720p 30fps streams at the same time in our computer, that just didnt work that well since no one had a good enough PC for that.\nOverall a success.\nCABRA CABRA (CAmpeonato BRAsileiro) was an idea I had to make a monthly small tournament, where each of them you won points, and with the points you got rewards, the amount of points you get was related to how well you did in the tournament, so if you win 3 months, you get 30 points, you win a gift card or something similar, get 100 points you win a t-shirt, eventually the points reset and you start winning the first rewards again.\nIt was a good idea in the concept, but it didnt work that well in practice.\nThe points that made it not work were:\nRequired 6+ players online at the same time to play Required 2 staff members online, they could not be also players A format that wasnt that easy to understand Money It was a good idea, but to do something monthly you need staff avaiable, and when your staff is also your players, it gets a bit complicated.\nIts sad that this didnt work out, it was a big idea that everybody could play, we had discord bots for the leaderboards and profiles, but sometimes big ideas cant be done.\nCopa Brasileira 1.16 3 Third edition of the Tournament, this one I was tackling alone, since most of the staff had other commitments, but i wanted to make sure it would be a great tournament.\nFirst I made a groupchat with everyone I tought would sign up, asked everything from format, design, dates, seeds, and other things, to make sure I wasnt making a tournament for me, but for the players.\nThe community wasnt that active at that time, and I needed 16 players to make the tournament happen, it was hard, but in the end i got 14 brazilians and 2 from Portugal, and only 1 player forfeited, good start.\nI also wanted to make sure that the tournament revived the community a bit, I wanted to make everyone, even the viewers, be able to participate in some way, and I was successful, The biggest things I did were:\nA minecraft server for the “starting soon” screen, where everyone could play around, and appear in the twitch livestream, something that made a lot of people join before the game started, to just fish and talk.\nA prize for who made the best prediction, we used the website challonge, that has a feature where anyone can make a prediction on the results of every match, and the one who got the closest, got a month of Discord Nitro, bigger stakes for every match, even the ones that people didnt care a lot.\nPeople really liked this tournament, it had a prizepool of R$800, and it was a success, the only issue was the scheduling issue, there was only 2 staff members, and i got extremly sick for a week.\nAnd after this tournament the community started to revive a bit, with some old players coming back and new ones appearing.\nBTRL COOP Same idea as the other BTRLs but with coop runs.\nIt went well, no issues on the hosting, or with the players, this tournament was mainly organized by another Admin, and he made the prizepool be R$500, without talking with the other admins, so when the announcement was made, it couldnt be changed. It isnt a lot of money if you think about the other events, but this one would only last a weekend, for a speedrun category that very few people care about in the world.\nOn the player side, there were some of the issues mentioned on the coop tournament from the beggining, Lag and other connection issues, firewall blocking, problems with the ISP, etc.\nBTRL 4 The biggest one yet, spanning the month of july 2025, with a prizepool of R$1960 between the 1st and 7th place, and a bonus of R$500 if someone breaks the Brazilian record.\nThis one had actually no issues, honestly a miracle.\nSome highlights on the staff side were:\n24/7 stream, we had a computer that a member lended us, and we streamed 24/7 Automatic overlay, i made a tool to automatically change who our stream was showing based on where each player was in their worlds, more info on the tools section Lots of community donations, an extra R$675 to the prizepool. Our tournament was displayed on paceman.gg, a website that shows stats about minecraft speedrunners, giving it a more official look, and more visibility The data analysis, 6m worlds, 6.6k Nether entries, and only 70 finished runs, just to visualize how hard it was to get the record. Revived the category that wasnt really played a lot anymore, due to MCSR Ranked. At the end everybody was exausted, some were happy, some were sad, but it was an amazing event that established our competitive Brazil scene.\nCopa Brasileira 1.16 | SERIE B There was a big wave of new players, and I wanted to make something just for them, just to make them see what tournaments are, and maybe ignite a flame inside them to become very competitive players, with a small prizepool of R$200.\nThe Serie B was a bracket single elimination tournament, with a group stage with 20 players, then a bracket with 12, Everyone in this tournament was pretty new to the game, but there was a big skill gap between some.\nOne of the biggest challenges was making sure that the tournament was fair, that the bracket was fair, that it could be fun for all players, this meant that a lot of the bracket didnt follow a formula, and was isntead hand picked, not the most normal thing to do, but this tournament was more about being fun and fair for everyone, and we had some problems because the best player in the tournament had to forfeit because his computer broke, right as the group stage finished.\nIn the technical side, we improved a lot of thing from the last Cup, better stream setup, better design, but the biggest thing was a program i developed, called ROBS, to remotely control an OBS instance, since our staff team is small, we do a lot of things at once, the person who is hosting is also commentating, or making the match for the players or anything else, so me being able to completly control the stream that is being hosted at another staff setup, helps a lot.\nDuring this tournament I also made a little discord bot so people on the discord server could bet a fake currency on things that could happen in the tournament, making it more interesting for the people that arent playing.\nAll the issues that happened in this one were quickly fixed, and it was overall an awesome tournament.\nWe have some events and tournaments in the making, the next iteration of the Copa Brasileira, and a tournament with several famous youtubers, were we pair them up with good speedrunners as coaches, but thats for the future.\nTools and Programs I made several tools to help us with the tournaments, and the community, some of them are:\nDatapacks Datapacks are the official way to make custom things in minecraft, it uses their own language, MCfunction, and we used it in the past to make some parts of the tournaments better, such as increase the luck, or make the luck standard, spawn mobs, or change some vanilla settings, as the years went by this was replaced with more official ways to host matches.\nXandeHR 2 BackEnd Weeks before the event, Alexandre contacted me to know about how his tournament could work, he had aorund 500k seeds he needed to put on some database, where then the players would open a link and get a random seed from that database, this would be its way to filter seeds.\nI made a very simple version to show how it could be done, but a mutual friend said he had it covered using a fancier stack, and he ended up doing it, and it didnt work.\nThe stack he had was a simple node front-end and a Firebase DB, Firebase is good for some situations, but not in the situation where you need to INSERT 500k rows, then have 12 people fetching them over the course of 24 hours, the free version of firebase has very strict limits, and when they tried testing it, it just didnt work, 500k rows on 1 table was too much for the Firebase free plan.\nAlexandre sent me a message around 1 AM, asking if i still had that simple example I made a while ago, and i helped him make a version that actually worked.\nThe project was simple, it was a node express Backend nothing fancy, no database at all, the 500k line .txt file just stayed there on the server, the moment the server started, it read the file, and put all the seeds on memory, in an array, then we made an endpoint /seed that would return a random seed from the array, and remove it from the array, so it wouldnt be repeated.\nThe biggest problem with this was that it didnt remove the seed from the actual file, so if the server crashed or needed to be restarted, it would repeat seeds, but this wasnt a big deal since even if happened the chances of the same person getting the same seed are low.\nTo get the seeds in the game we used AutoHotKey, it fetches the api runs a regex to get the seed and copies and pastes it in world creation input.\nNo database was used, no money was spent, just some hacky code and AutoHotKey, but it worked flawlessly.\nBTRL 4 Tools I wanted to make the BTRL 24/7, and there was a simple path to do that.\nPaceman.gg is a website that displays where each minecraft speedrunner is in the world and what time, they can do that because speedrunners use a mod that allows for that. The Paceman API has a lot of info, but the one that matters in their twitch, they can link their twitch, and if their are live, we can watch them.\nThe idea was simple, we whitelist all the players that will be playing in the BTRL in the JS of a website, the website is just the twitch player, if the player is in a good pace, we replace whoever is in the screen if them, if add some timeouts for this pace, some safegaurds, and we have a 24/7 stream that always shows who has the best pace.\nThe decision of what is a good pace was a bit hard, we have some events like: Enter Nether, Enter Bastion, Enter Fortress, Finding Stronghold, Found Stronghold and Entered End. Each one of these events has a weight, and we calculate the pace based on the time it took to do these events, and the weight of each event.\nROBS OBS is the program that almost everyone uses to livestream and record, it has so many features so many tools, plugins, scripts and more, but it didnt one thing that i wanted, it didnt have a way to control it from another computer, making some custom buttons, inputs, and I knew that OBS had a websocket that allowed for that, so i made a tool to control it from another computer, and i kepts adding things to it.\nIt started very simple, I could change scenes start and end stream, already super useful, then to allow for new things in the OBS overlay, i added controls for specific sources, to control arguments in URLs, so i can change text, twitch player channel, and more.\nThis program also allows me to only show some things in it, it only shows sources that start with a _\nThis program is probrally one of the most useful things i have made, it allows for so much control and better coordination between the staff, someone can control the audio and points, someone can control the scenes, someone can control the position of sources, everything from the same OBS instance, no need to pay for a service host a server or anything, just a websocket connection\n","wordCount":"3583","inLanguage":"en","image":"http://localhost:1313/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"2020-09-15T11:30:03Z","dateModified":"2020-09-15T11:30:03Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Me"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:1313/posts/mcsr/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"ExampleSite","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://localhost:1313/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://localhost:1313/ accesskey=h title="Thomas Bocalon (Alt + H)"><img src=http://localhost:1313/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Thomas Bocalon</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">

In the end we manually checked around 2000 seeds, with around 90 of them being actually good.</p><p>In this Tournament I also had the chance to be a commentator of a match, which I was very nervous about, since It was in english and i was 15 years old, but it was a lot of fun, and there is this funny clip of my dog barking in the livestream with 100+ people</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/minecraftjavaspeedrunning/clip/FuriousElegantBottleChocolateRain?filter=clips&amp;range=all&amp;sort=time">Twitch clip</a></strong></p><h2 id=copa-brasileira-116>Copa Brasileira 1.16<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#copa-brasileira-116>#</a></h2><p>This tournament was bound to have issues, we had a smaller staff, since the brazilian community is smaller, everyone was doing a little bit of everything, and the staff was made up of people aged 21 to 12 years old, so you can guess how that went.</p><p>This time I had more things to do, I had to check the Seeds, make the overlays for the twitch livestream and be the stream tech, organize with the players to know when they can play, make the bracket, comentate matches and more, everyone was doing a little bit of everything, which means no one was doing things right.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/minecraftspeedrunbrasil/clip/GiftedLovelyPizzaTwitchRPG-q0Lzj4my6ReKUlyM?filter=clips&amp;range=all&amp;sort=time">Twitch Clip</a></strong></p><p>This was the first tournament where I had to actually deal with technical issues and problems with the players, all of them stuck in my mind so I dont repeat them in the future, some examples:</p><ul><li>Sub par seeds, we didnt have a proper standard between the staff on what is a good seed</li><li>Bad Stream overlay, we made it in 15 minutes, it didnt have the chat in the screen and other useful info</li><li>Bad communication with the players, about match times, rules, format etc.</li><li>Technical problems, maps and other resources we made to make the matches better not working</li></ul><p>A problem that people still remember is when SpectroPlayer, a popular Youtuber, lost a match, didnt understand the format of the tournament, then didnt respond any of our messages asking him to schedule his next match, which lead to the whole tournament stalling for a while, and a lot people having resentments towards him, something that eventually made him and another youtuber leave the community.</p><p>This tournament had no prizepool, we didnt even consider giving money away.</p><h2 id=116-duos-tournament>1.16 Duos Tournament<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#116-duos-tournament>#</a></h2><p>This Tournament was cancelled, but I think its worth a mention.</p><p>In my opinion the key issues were:</p><ul><li>There wasnt a lot of interest in Coop speedrunning, it is a fun gimmick, but not a lot of people want to actually do it</li><li>Schedule problems, instead of 2 players + Staff per match its 4 players + Staff, and a lot of the staff was going to play too, so it was a scheduling nightmare, and we didnt have the proper system for that.</li><li>Technical problems, sometimes you cant connect to your friends world, and no one can pinpoint the issue, because its usually not the players fault, sometimes its the Firewall, sometimes its your ISP.</li><li>Lag, a lot of players didnt play or hosted coop runs up until that point, and the lag some people had could make it frustrating to play.</li></ul><h2 id=other-tournaments>Other Tournaments<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#other-tournaments>#</a></h2><p>There were some tournaments and events I didn&rsquo;t do a lot, some of them i will write more in the &ldquo;tools&rdquo; section, but others i just didnt have much to do with</p><h3 id=btrl-1--2>BTRL 1 & 2<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#btrl-1--2>#</a></h3><p>BTRL or Break the record live is a marathon event, players have X amount of time to get the best time possible in a specific category, with the main objective being to break the record. These 2 events didnt need a lot of preparation, setup, since its just the players playing solo while streaming to twitch, where we then use those streams to feed into our main stream.</p><p>BTRL 2 had R$165 of prizepool, donated by a member from the community.</p><h3 id=xandehr-1--2>XandeHR 1 & 2<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#xandehr-1--2>#</a></h3><p>XandeHR was also a marathon event, players had a limited amount of hours to get the biggest amount of times below a certain time.</p><p>The diferencial of this event was that the seeds players were getting werent random, they where filtered seeds that had better structures for speedrunning, making it more fun to play.</p><p>The name is a play on the name of the organizer, Alexandre.</p><p>My contribution to this event was in XandeHR 2, where the system to get the filtered seeds in the game stopped working in the dawn of the event, so at 3AM I was making a new simpler solution so they didnt need to cancel the event.</p><h2 id=copa-brasileira-116-2>Copa Brasileira 1.16 2<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#copa-brasileira-116-2>#</a></h2><p>This was the second edition of the tournament that first took place 2 years ago, this time we wanted to do something bigger, with a prizepool, get more viewers and just make a better looking tournament.</p><p>We had:</p><ul><li>Matches streamed in a bigger channel, SpeedrunsBrasil, with 50k followers</li><li>Good looking stream overlay</li><li>R$750 on the Prizepool, donated by various community members</li><li>Better game tools</li></ul><p>But we also had problems, some with the channel that was streaming our matches, not having control over our &ldquo;output&rdquo; and times that the matches could happen was something that stressed people a bit, because of this we only have 1 of all the matches that were streamed, all the others ones are lost, since they werent on our channel.</p><p>Other than the host problems, and some other minor staff fighting, the tournament was a success, but in everything that we made from this point onward we needed to have 100% control over what was ours.</p><h2 id=copa-brasileira-114>Copa Brasileira 1.14<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#copa-brasileira-114>#</a></h2><p>This was a bad one.</p><p>Its hard to explain this one, the version 1.14 isn&rsquo;t that fun to play for the average player, few people play it in the world, its boring to watch, but 2 admins really liked this version, so this tournament was made, with a R$425 prizepool.</p><p>Some of the problems:</p><ul><li>People didnt want to play the tournament, organizers had to beg and guilt trip players to participate.</li><li>Some were happy that they were eliminated, not really good for a competitive tournament.</li><li>Staff didnt want to host or comentate the tournament.</li><li>The community didnt want to watch it, it was boring.</li><li>People dropped out of the tournament, people signed up but changed their minds last second.</li></ul><p>A lot of matches were played, but it got to the point where no one wanted to host play or do anything, and the community didnt want to watch it, i contacted everyone who donated to the prizepool, explained the situation, they agreed to use the money for other tournaments, and it was cancelled.</p><p>The tournament was a failure, but it was a learning experience to only do things that the broader community thinks is cool, otherwise we get no support.</p><h2 id=btrl-3>BTRL 3<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#btrl-3>#</a></h2><p>This was in december of 2023, a break the record live event, at first with only R$123 in prizepool, but then we got a donation for R$1000 for the person who beats the Brazilian record, valid until the end of 2023, the biggest prizepool up to that point.</p><p>Boosterruns was the one to claim the prize in the second day of the event, no one else came close so he &ldquo;went home&rdquo; with an extra 1k in his pocket, this event was pretty much the &ldquo;start&rdquo; of a new era, with tournaments with bigger prizes, better quality of the production and the overall skill of the players getting better.</p><p>The biggest challenge of this one was the livestream, i coded something to make changing who was the main player on the livestream easier, but we still had the problem of rendering 5 720p 30fps streams at the same time in our computer, that just didnt work that well since no one had a good enough PC for that.</p><p>Overall a success.</p><h2 id=cabra>CABRA<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#cabra>#</a></h2><p>CABRA (CAmpeonato BRAsileiro) was an idea I had to make a monthly small tournament, where each of them you won points, and with the points you got rewards, the amount of points you get was related to how well you did in the tournament, so if you win 3 months, you get 30 points, you win a gift card or something similar, get 100 points you win a t-shirt, eventually the points reset and you start winning the first rewards again.</p><p>It was a good idea in the concept, but it didnt work that well in practice.</p><p>The points that made it not work were:</p><ul><li>Required 6+ players online at the same time to play</li><li>Required 2 staff members online, they could not be also players</li><li>A format that wasnt that easy to understand</li><li>Money</li></ul><p>It was a good idea, but to do something monthly you need staff avaiable, and when your staff is also your players, it gets a bit complicated.</p><p>Its sad that this didnt work out, it was a big idea that everybody could play, we had discord bots for the leaderboards and profiles, but sometimes big ideas cant be done.</p><h2 id=copa-brasileira-116-3>Copa Brasileira 1.16 3<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#copa-brasileira-116-3>#</a></h2><p>Third edition of the Tournament, this one I was tackling alone, since most of the staff had other commitments, but i wanted to make sure it would be a great tournament.</p><p>First I made a groupchat with everyone I tought would sign up, asked everything from format, design, dates, seeds, and other things, to make sure I wasnt making a tournament for me, but for the players.</p><p>The community wasnt that active at that time, and I needed 16 players to make the tournament happen, it was hard, but in the end i got 14 brazilians and 2 from Portugal, and only 1 player forfeited, good start.</p><p>I also wanted to make sure that the tournament revived the community a bit, I wanted to make everyone, even the viewers, be able to participate in some way, and I was successful, The biggest things I did were:</p><p>A minecraft server for the &ldquo;starting soon&rdquo; screen, where everyone could play around, and appear in the twitch livestream, something that made a lot of people join before the game started, to just fish and talk.</p><p>A prize for who made the best prediction, we used the website challonge, that has a feature where anyone can make a prediction on the results of every match, and the one who got the closest, got a month of Discord Nitro, bigger stakes for every match, even the ones that people didnt care a lot.</p><p>People really liked this tournament, it had a prizepool of R$800, and it was a success, the only issue was the scheduling issue, there was only 2 staff members, and i got extremly sick for a week.</p><p>And after this tournament the community started to revive a bit, with some old players coming back and new ones appearing.</p><h2 id=btrl-coop>BTRL COOP<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#btrl-coop>#</a></h2><p>Same idea as the other BTRLs but with coop runs.</p><p>It went well, no issues on the hosting, or with the players, this tournament was mainly organized by another Admin, and he made the prizepool be R$500, without talking with the other admins, so when the announcement was made, it couldnt be changed. It isnt a lot of money if you think about the other events, but this one would only last a weekend, for a speedrun category that very few people care about in the world.</p><p>On the player side, there were some of the issues mentioned on the coop tournament from the beggining, Lag and other connection issues, firewall blocking, problems with the ISP, etc.</p><h2 id=btrl-4>BTRL 4<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#btrl-4>#</a></h2><p>The biggest one yet, spanning the month of july 2025, with a prizepool of R$1960 between the 1st and 7th place, and a bonus of R$500 if someone breaks the Brazilian record.</p><p>This one had actually no issues, honestly a miracle.</p><p>Some highlights on the staff side were:</p><ul><li>24/7 stream, we had a computer that a member lended us, and we streamed 24/7</li><li>Automatic overlay, i made a tool to automatically change who our stream was showing based on where each player was in their worlds, more info on the tools section</li><li>Lots of community donations, an extra R$675 to the prizepool.</li><li>Our tournament was displayed on paceman.gg, a website that shows stats about minecraft speedrunners, giving it a more official look, and more visibility</li><li>The data analysis, 6m worlds, 6.6k Nether entries, and only 70 finished runs, just to visualize how hard it was to get the record.</li><li>Revived the category that wasnt really played a lot anymore, due to MCSR Ranked.</li></ul><p>At the end everybody was exausted, some were happy, some were sad, but it was an amazing event that established our competitive Brazil scene.</p><h2 id=copa-brasileira-116--serie-b>Copa Brasileira 1.16 | SERIE B<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#copa-brasileira-116--serie-b>#</a></h2><p>There was a big wave of new players, and I wanted to make something just for them, just to make them see what tournaments are, and maybe ignite a flame inside them to become very competitive players, with a small prizepool of R$200.</p><p>The Serie B was a bracket single elimination tournament, with a group stage with 20 players, then a bracket with 12, Everyone in this tournament was pretty new to the game, but there was a big skill gap between some.</p><p>One of the biggest challenges was making sure that the tournament was fair, that the bracket was fair, that it could be fun for all players, this meant that a lot of the bracket didnt follow a formula, and was isntead hand picked, not the most normal thing to do, but this tournament was more about being fun and fair for everyone, and we had some problems because the best player in the tournament had to forfeit because his computer broke, right as the group stage finished.</p><p>In the technical side, we improved a lot of thing from the last Cup, better stream setup, better design, but the biggest thing was a program i developed, called ROBS, to remotely control an OBS instance, since our staff team is small, we do a lot of things at once, the person who is hosting is also commentating, or making the match for the players or anything else, so me being able to completly control the stream that is being hosted at another staff setup, helps a lot.</p><p>During this tournament I also made a little discord bot so people on the discord server could bet a fake currency on things that could happen in the tournament, making it more interesting for the people that arent playing.</p><p>All the issues that happened in this one were quickly fixed, and it was overall an awesome tournament.</p><p>We have some events and tournaments in the making, the next iteration of the Copa Brasileira, and a tournament with several famous youtubers, were we pair them up with good speedrunners as coaches, but thats for the future.</p><h1 id=tools-and-programs>Tools and Programs<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#tools-and-programs>#</a></h1><p>I made several tools to help us with the tournaments, and the community, some of them are:</p><h2 id=datapacks>Datapacks<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#datapacks>#</a></h2><p>Datapacks are the official way to make custom things in minecraft, it uses their own language, MCfunction, and we used it in the past to make some parts of the tournaments better, such as increase the luck, or make the luck standard, spawn mobs, or change some vanilla settings, as the years went by this was replaced with more official ways to host matches.</p><h2 id=xandehr-2-backend>XandeHR 2 BackEnd<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#xandehr-2-backend>#</a></h2><p>Weeks before the event, Alexandre contacted me to know about how his tournament could work, he had aorund 500k seeds he needed to put on some database, where then the players would open a link and get a random seed from that database, this would be its way to filter seeds.</p><p>I made a very simple version to show how it could be done, but a mutual friend said he had it covered using a fancier stack, and he ended up doing it, and it didnt work.</p><p>The stack he had was a simple node front-end and a Firebase DB, Firebase is good for some situations, but not in the situation where you need to INSERT 500k rows, then have 12 people fetching them over the course of 24 hours, the free version of firebase has very strict limits, and when they tried testing it, it just didnt work, 500k rows on 1 table was too much for the Firebase free plan.</p><p>Alexandre sent me a message around 1 AM, asking if i still had that simple example I made a while ago, and i helped him make a version that actually worked.</p><p>The project was simple, it was a node express Backend nothing fancy, no database at all, the 500k line .txt file just stayed there on the server, the moment the server started, it read the file, and put all the seeds on memory, in an array, then we made an endpoint /seed that would return a random seed from the array, and remove it from the array, so it wouldnt be repeated.</p><p>The biggest problem with this was that it didnt remove the seed from the actual file, so if the server crashed or needed to be restarted, it would repeat seeds, but this wasnt a big deal since even if happened the chances of the same person getting the same seed are low.</p><p>To get the seeds in the game we used AutoHotKey, it fetches the api runs a regex to get the seed and copies and pastes it in world creation input.</p><p>No database was used, no money was spent, just some hacky code and AutoHotKey, but it worked flawlessly.</p><h2 id=btrl-4-tools>BTRL 4 Tools<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#btrl-4-tools>#</a></h2><p>I wanted to make the BTRL 24/7, and there was a simple path to do that.</p><p>Paceman.gg is a website that displays where each minecraft speedrunner is in the world and what time, they can do that because speedrunners use a mod that allows for that. The Paceman API has a lot of info, but the one that matters in their twitch, they can link their twitch, and if their are live, we can watch them.</p><p>The idea was simple, we whitelist all the players that will be playing in the BTRL in the JS of a website, the website is just the twitch player, if the player is in a good pace, we replace whoever is in the screen if them, if add some timeouts for this pace, some safegaurds, and we have a 24/7 stream that always shows who has the best pace.</p><p>The decision of what is a good pace was a bit hard, we have some events like: Enter Nether, Enter Bastion, Enter Fortress, Finding Stronghold, Found Stronghold and Entered End. Each one of these events has a weight, and we calculate the pace based on the time it took to do these events, and the weight of each event.</p><h2 id=robs>ROBS<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#robs>#</a></h2><p>OBS is the program that almost everyone uses to livestream and record, it has so many features so many tools, plugins, scripts and more, but it didnt one thing that i wanted, it didnt have a way to control it from another computer, making some custom buttons, inputs, and I knew that OBS had a websocket that allowed for that, so i made a tool to control it from another computer, and i kepts adding things to it.</p><p>It started very simple, I could change scenes start and end stream, already super useful, then to allow for new things in the OBS overlay, i added controls for specific sources, to control arguments in URLs, so i can change text, twitch player channel, and more.</p><p>This program also allows me to only show some things in it, it only shows sources that start with a _</p><p>This program is probrally one of the most useful things i have made, it allows for so much control and better coordination between the staff, someone can control the audio and points, someone can control the scenes, someone can control the position of sources, everything from the same OBS instance, no need to pay for a service host a server or anything, just a websocket connection</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul></footer></article></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2025 <a href=http://localhost:1313/>ExampleSite</a></span> ·
